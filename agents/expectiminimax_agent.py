# === Expectiminimax Algorithm ===
# Extend the Minimax algorithm to handle games involving both adversarial and chance elements
# Implement a recursive function that evaluates three types of nodes:
# - Max nodes: Choose the move with the maximum expected utility.
# - Min nodes: Choose the move with the minimum expected utility.
# - Expectation nodes: Calculate the expected utility as the weighted average of all possible outcomes based on their probabilities.
# Define utility values for terminal game states and integrate probabilistic outcomes to guide optimal decision-making
# Feel free to add parameters or adjust these functions as needed
